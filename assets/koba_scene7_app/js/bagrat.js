	"Clever, Koba.  I like that.  It almost sounds like the truth.",
	"I thought you'd give up.  You always did before.",
	"Village Twenty.  The ugliest village on the OZET, full of the ugliest people.  Wouldn't you agree?",
	"Well, technically the others aren't living underground; they live above the sky-dome.  It's farther away from you peasants."
