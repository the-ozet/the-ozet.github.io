	"Chairman Bagrat.",
	"I'm not here about Endzela.",
	"I thought it was you who kicked me off the case.  But it wasn't.",
	"I want to know who he was.  The stranger.",
	"You're harvesting a little colony of silk worms down there, aren't you?  Pale, plump, hungry worms.",
	"You thought you could take care of the problem yourself, didn't you, Chairman?  Be a hero.",
	"You told Endzela your secret, didn't you?",
	"Poor Utscha.",
	"I know Utscha's face.  I looked into his dead eyes when we pulled him out of the stream, but I hadn't seen your face in years, so I couldn't be sure.  Look at you though.  You knew he was your father.  And you killed him anyway.",
	"What I want to know is this: did you really have to kill him just because he took a walk in the woods?",
	"Sloppy.  Very sloppy.",
	"She has a name: Endzela.  Use it.",
	"You're done, Bagrat.",
	"I've sent letters to the other members of the council.  If half of what I wrote is true, they'll skewer you.",
	"I had to walk a lot.  I went to the river... followed the towpath.  Then I saw footprints leading off into the forest.",
	"I heard music... out there, in the middle of the forest.  It was coming from a kind of lean-to made out of sticks and blankets.",
	"Endzela told Utscha about the people underground.  Utscha sold the story to me, though he got it a little bit wrong.  Then you found out that Utscha was talking.  And you couldn't let him keep talking.",
	"A whole society, hiding just below us for fifteen generations, eating our food while we starve and wait.",
	"How many people are living down there?",
	"Nice tune.  Where have I heard that before?",
	"Two bodies already.  Why did your guys let me live?  Why not three?"
