<p class="direction">Throughout the piece, trumpet and guitar are always unamplified and in competition with extremely loud ambient noise.  For the overture, there is a moment at the beginning when 3 and 5 are playing in the clear, just the acoustic sounds.  Suddenly, the ambient noise surges in and for the rest of the overture, the instruments are battling along with the sound.  This lift-off ambient sound is the loudest of all the sound in the piece.</p>
<p class="direction">TASK SIGNAL interrupts the playing and the ambient noise floor establishes itself.</p>
<p class="question set">What is the cockpit setup?  The idea is to have a fixed camera angle facing two seats. What kind of backdrop do we need?  What kind of chairs would look like cockpit seats?  Can we get two airline seats?</p>
