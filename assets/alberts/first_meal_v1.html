<p class="direction">When 3 and 5 finish playing the overture, the ambient noise floor changes and settles into the standard "on board" noise.</p>

</p>
<p class="direction">3 and 5 bring their instruments to their respective sleeping boxes.</p>
<p class="direction">TASK SIGNAL.</p>
<p class="direction">Albert 3 leaves the visible playing area.</p>
<p class="direction">Albert 5 goes to shared space and sets the table.  Through the rest of the piece, all objects need to be attached to surfaces when they are not being handled.  For example, food containers might lock directly into the tabletop, or be strapped down with cords or something.  Utensils might snap into special clips on the edge of the table.  Etc.  The point is to communicate the constraints of and work associated with living in zero gravity without trying to convey the illusion that there actually is no gravity.</p>
<p class="direction">There are two large bladders hanging from the ceiling above the table.  Each has a drinking tube coming out of it.</p>
<p class="direction">Albert 5 pulls a cuff, something like a neck brace attached to a long tube or cable, out from under the table.</p>
<p class="direction">He sits at his chair, and buckles himself in.</p>
<p class="direction">Albert 5 fastens the cuff around his neck.</p>
<p class="direction">Waits.</p>
<p class="direction">Waits.</p>
<p class="direction">Waits.</p>
<p class="direction">Finally, Albert 3 returns.</p>

	What happened to you?</dd>
	<dt>3</dt><dd>
	The valve wouldn't open.<br/>
	I put my dick in the sheath<br/>
	which was ICE cold<br/>
	I tightened the seal and then I tried to open the valve<br/>
	and the wheel<br/>
	would<br/>
	NOT MOVE.<br/>
	Jesus.<br/>
	We could have ended up drowning in my piss.<br/>
	Don't you want to go?</dd>
	<dt>5</dt><dd>
	I want to eat.</dd>
	<dt>3</dt><dd>
	What?</dd>
	<dt>5</dt><dd>
	I want to eat.</dd>
	<dt>3</dt><dd>
	OK.<br>
	Then I was afraid to unfasten myself.<br/>
	I thought my dick might be frozen to the sheath.</dd>
	<dt>5</dt><dd>
	Can you turn me on?</dd>

<p class="direction">Albert 3 activates Albert 5's monitor.  The ambient noise increases.</p>
<p class="direction">Albert 3 gets his own cuff, flips his switch.  The ambient noise increases again.  He sits in his chair, buckles himself in, and fastens the cuff around his neck.</p>
<p class="direction">Albert 5 takes hold of his drinking tube.</p>
<p class="direction">Albert 3 does the same.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>5</dt><dd>
	Budim!</dd>
	<dt>3</dt><dd>
	Budim.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="direction">Vicious, loud, squealing feedback as they speak (heard from the front, as ambient noise).  They drink, and the sounds of the throat monitors settle into something more bearable.</p>
<p class="direction">They eat and drink.  Monitoring sounds.</p>
<p class="direction">3 finishes before 5. He takes off his cuff, turns off his monitor, and puts away the cuff.</p>

	My wife is an excellent cook, but I hate eating supper at home.<br>
	Man can't be himself sitting at a table with women and children.<br>
	You're going to get married?<br>
	You're going to marry that woman in the picture?
	<p class="direction">5 shrugs and eats.</p>
	You'll be a famous man when we get home.<br>
	She'll want to marry you.  Hm?<br>
	You might hold out though.<br>
	A famous man has options.</dd>

<p class="direction">3 burps, stretches, stands and goes to his bed. Each bed is a small box, roughly 5 feet by 2 feet -- just large enough to stuff a body in.  They may even be upright (as they are on the international space station), whereas in the pre-show they were horizontal like normal beds.  On the back wall of the bed is a round window covered by a piece of vinyl snapped in place over it.  3 takes out his guitar and tries to find a comfortable position in which to play, but he can barely get into the bed while holding it.  After struggling for a minute he puts it down.</p>
<p class="direction">TASK SIGNAL.</p>
<p class="direction">5 finishes his meal, puts things away, turns off the lights in the main area, and exits toward the cockpit.</p>
<p class="direction">3 reaches across his bed and pulls the cover from the window.  The other side of the glass is covered over as well.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>3</dt><dd>
	Motherfuckers.  They covered the window from the outside!  Hey! Hey!  They covered the windows from the outside!</dd>
