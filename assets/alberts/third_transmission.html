		He married her.<br/>
		Her father was a glazier and Timothy Tyler drove the truck and learned to carry windows.<br/>

		Your brother is your brother not your friend.<br/>
		His sister is another fellow's wife.<br/>
		Grandfather lost Grandmother one July: the strain just did her in, with your father in her womb.<br/>
		"I missed her, but married again", said Grandfather with a pull upon his pipe.<br/>
		"Will my son look like me, or like her?", you wonder.<br/>
		"Like me, I hope," you say out loud.<br/>
		And then your wife, who does not know you yet, unbraids her hair.
