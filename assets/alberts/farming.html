		Imagine a spherical shell ten miles or so in diameter.  The great bulk of the structure would be made out of the substance of one or more smaller asteroids or rings of Saturn or some other planetary detritus. The early stages of construction will probably consist of attaching a sufficiently large asteroid to a space vessel, hollowing it out and using the removed material to build the first protective shell. Without a strong enough gravitational field, the globe would have to keep its atmosphere and the greater portion of its life on the inside, and these would be nourished by energy absorbed through its outer surface, like an enormously complicated single-celled plant.<br/>

		The essential positive activity of the colony would be in the development, growth and reproduction of the globe. Development would have to proceed either in a crustacean-like manner, the pioneers putting together a new and better globe inside the larger one, which could be subsequently broken open and re-absorbed; or, as the mollusks do it: building out of new sections in a spiral form.<br/>

		Or more probably like protozoa behave, building a new globe outside the original globe, but in contact with it until it should be in a position to set up an independent existence.<br/>

		There would probably be no more need for government than in a modern hotel: there would be a few restrictions concerned with the safety of the vessel and that would be all.

<p class="direction">Together they wrap the mattress around one of the speakers producing the ambient noise and tape it in place.  It becomes clear they still have their motion monitors on as they wrestle with the task, and the speakers respond horribly.</p>

<p class="direction">3 turns and heads toward 5's bunk.  As he goes by, 5 punches him in the head.  3 grabs 5 by the hatitard and almost punches him in the face.  Then he turns and goes for the mattress.  He drags it back to the shared space and wraps it around the other speaker on his own.</p>

<p class="direction">Albert 5 exits to the cockpit.  Albert 3 finishes with the second speaker.  He clears up the farming stuff.</p>
