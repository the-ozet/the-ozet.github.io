	<dd>Good morning.<br/>
		I'd like to report my success in applying Korkhasov's methods of bladder control and<br/>
		to recommend<br/>
		once more<br/>
		that the training program formally integrate these methods in the future.<br/><br/>
		I experienced very little discomfort during our thirteen hour sequestration in the capsule.  Even under the<br/>
		most intense gavitational force I was<br/>
		just fine.<br/><br/>
		I also found it perfectly easy to release my bladder as soon as I was at liberty to do so.<br/>
		I know this was not the case for Albert 3.<br/>
		This is particularly significant in light of the racial difference between us,
		which he revealed to me<br/>
		and of which you must already be aware.<br/>
		Significant because, as you may also know,<br/>
		Leontov determined Caucasians have both smaller<br/>
		and weaker<br/>
		bladders than the Semitic people.<br/>
		Still, Korkhasov's techniques helped me overcome my racial disadvantage in this particular respect.<br/>
		Some other observations:<br/>
		The meditational aspects<br/>
		of Korkhasov's practice fortified my mental state throughout our ascent. As the Yogis of India<br/>
		lie happily on beds of nails,<br/>
		I simply focused on the relaxation and distension of my bladder and my anxieties passed.  Even<br/>
		surprising feelings of anger that rose up in me toward...<br/>
		everyone really...<br/>
		groundless emotional fluctuations which I attribute to the deoxygenation of the blood under high force...<br/>
		I was able to defeat these negative and counterproductive states through applying Korkhasov's methods.<br/><br/>
		Let me run the risk of overstating my case for just another moment.<br/>
		If Korkhasov's techniques could be adopted more generally<br/>
		throughout society,<br/>
		I believe we would produce a population that was,<br/>
		regardless of race,<br/>
		better fit to live the life we now set out to investigate.<br/>
		Lysenko's science of the inheritance of acquired characteristics assures us that future generations<br/>
		of Caucasians<br/>
		could catch up to the Jews in respect to their bladders, and make intraplanetary living a less daunting prospect for the average person.<br/>
		I intend to contiue my investigations throughout the mission, and to write them up when I return.  I believe the scientific journal "Progress" would be interested in publishing the results of such a study.<br/>
		Transmitted at... 8:35am... Friday the 11th of June.<br/></dd>
