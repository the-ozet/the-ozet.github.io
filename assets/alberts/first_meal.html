<p class="direction">Alberts 3 and 5 go to the shared space and set the table.  Through the rest of the piece, all objects need to be attached to surfaces when they are not being handled.  For example, food containers are strapped to the tabletop with cords.  Utensils might snap into special clips on the edge of the table.  Etc.  The point is to communicate the constraints of and work associated with living in zero gravity without trying to convey the illusion that there actually is no gravity.</p>

		This is how Civilization started:<br/>
		A man and a man sat down at a table.<br/>
		Or they sat down at the stump of a fallen tree,<br/>
		or, I imagine, face to face across a big flat rock<br/>
		a long time ago.<br/>
		Now<br/>
		you and I are here and we brought<br/>
		a table with us.<br/>
	</dd>
	<dt>3</dt><dd>
		The first space table.
	</dd>
	<dt>5</dt><dd>
		We are not the first men in space,<br/>
		but we are the men who carried a table<br/>
		off the face of the earth to prove<br/>
		that civilization can thrive somewhere new.<br/>

		There will be a holiday.<br/>
	</dd>
	<dt>3</dt><dd>
		Men will gather at tables for a meal of<br/>
		meat in a box and<br/>
		toasted black bread<br/>
		in honor<br/>
		of the first time two guys<br/>
		sat down together like gentlemen in the middle of<br/>
		the darkest, nastiest nothing<br/>
		this side of death.<br/>

<p class="direction">3 and 5 stop eating.  3 starts clearing the table and transitioning the space to the calesthenics setup.  5 and exits toward the cockpit.</p>
