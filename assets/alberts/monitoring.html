		Imagine<br/>
		a spherical shell<br/>
		ten miles or so in diameter.<br/>
		The great bulk of the structure would be made out of the substance of one or more smaller<br/>
		asteroids<br/>
		or rings of Saturn or<br/>
		some other planetary detritus.<br/>
		The early stages of construction will probably consist of attaching a sufficiently large asteroid<br/>
		to a space vessel,<br/>
		hollowing it out<br/>
		and using the removed material to build the first protective shell.<br/>
		Without a strong enough gravitational field, the globe would have to keep its atmosphere and the greater portion of its life<br/>
		on the inside.<br/>
		Nourishment would have to come through<br/>
		its outer surface,<br/>
		like an enormously complicated single-celled plant.<br/>
		<p class="direction">Silence from 5.</p>
		The essential positive activity<br/>
		of the colony<br/>
		would be in the development, growth<br/>
		and reproduction<br/>
		of the globe.<br/>
		Development would have to proceed in a crustacean-like manner,<br/>
		the pioneers putting together a new and better globe<br/>
		inside the larger one, which could be<br/>
		subsequently<br/>
		broken open<br/>
		and re-absorbed; or,<br/>
		as the mollusks do it:<br/>
		building out of new sections in a spiral form.<br/>
		<p class="direction">Silence from 5.</p>
		Or more probably like protozoa behave, building a new globe<br/>
		outside the original globe,<br/>
		but in contact with it<br/>
		until it should be in a position to set up an independent existence.<br/>
		<p class="direction">Silence from 5.</p>
		There would probably be no more need for government than in a modern hotel: there would be a few restrictions concerned with the safety of the vessel and that would be all.

<p class="direction">3 turns and heads toward 5's bed.  As he goes by, 5 punches him in the head.  3 grabs 5 by the hatitard and almost punches him in the face.  Then he turns and goes for the bed.  He drags the sleeping bag back to the shared space and wraps it around the other speaker on his own.</p>
