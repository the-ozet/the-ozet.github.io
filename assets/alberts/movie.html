<p class="direction">Lights out.  Alberts movie plays.</p>
<p class="direction">After last shot of Alberts movie, monitors shift to lift off film (3 and 5 in cockpit, facing forward).  3 and 5 enter for overture and set themselves downstage with instruments.  When they are set lights come up on 3 and 5 on stage.</p>
<p class="note">Make sure that in cockpit film, 3 and 5 are on the same side of each other as in the last shot of the Alberts movie, and also that stage positions match this arrangement.</p>
