The release of "The Transmissions EP" marks the beginning of our OZET 10th anniversary celebration.

For the next year, we'll be cataloging and resurfacing our scores, films, scripts, recordings, performance footage, software, photos, and other ephemera.  We'll put out new and unreleased work.  And we'll continue developing and looking forward to a production of of OoRT, our next evening-length live piece.

### About the Transmissions

In January 2011, Aaron had just reached the end of a hectic stretch of work, composing and doing sound design for plays across the country with Daniel Baker (as Broken Chord Collective).  He and Scott had been making OZET pieces for almost three and a half years, but five months had passed since their last piece, *Alberts I-V*.  He, Scott, and Daniel were playing around with the idea of forming an OZET Band.  Aaron's son, Leon, was less than a year old.

Aaron sat down on the 16th of the month and recorded a [short instrumental track](https://soundcloud.com/on_the_ozet/t-1102-1-16?in=on_the_ozet/sets/ozet-music-transmissions) in his apartment in Washington Heights.

He called the track a "transmission."  We can't now remember exactly why, but messages -- transmitted between earth and the OZET, between generations of Pioneers, between OZET villages, between the underground and the uninformed, the imprisoned and the free -- have played an important role in nearly all of our pieces.

Over the next seven years, he wrote at least [40 more transmissions](https://soundcloud.com/on_the_ozet/sets/ozet-music-transmissions).  Each piece was built off one of the eight melodies of the [Bernal Project Formulas](http://localhost.nytimes.com:4000/assets/scores/bernal-formula.pdf).  Sometimes the original formula is still discernible; often not.  OZET Band performed a few of the transmissions during their first live show on Hart Street in Brooklyn, on July 20, 2011.  Many of the transmissions found their way into OZET performances such as *Common Hall Village 20* and *Katorga*.  Scott added words to some of them later; all were wordless when written except one.

This past summer, we invited four of our favorite musicians -- Matt Mitchell (piano), Kate Gentile (drums), Devin Hoff (bass) and Taylor Levine (guitar) -- into the studio to record songs from the OZET Songbook and a selection of Transmissions.  We've collected those reimagined Transmissions here.  Frequent OZET collaborator Jesse Perez also appears on the album, in the role of the Historian.
