Four years into our decade-long OZET project, Aaron emailed his collaborators a transmission: a short instrumental piece he wrote TKTK.  Over the next six year he wrote TKTK more.  He played and recorded all of them on his own using TKTK.  Some made their way into evening-length pieces like TKTK.  The OZET BAND performed transmissions TKTK and TKTK at their first live concert on Hart Street in  Brooklyn, on July 20th 2011.

The release of "The Transmissions EP" marks the beginning of our 10th anniversary celebration. We invited four of our favorite musicians into the studio to record songs from the OZET Songbook and a selection of Transmissions.  We've collected the reimagined Transmissions here.  Frequent OZET collaborator Jesse Perez also appears on the album, in the role of the Historian.
