As part of The Exponential Festival (January 5-7, 2017) we performed <i>OoRT Prologue: Seed Silent in the Field</i> at Vital Joint in Brooklyn.

<i>OoRT Prologue</i>, a theatrical-musical ritual, portrays the role of the Cousins of Village 4 in maintaining the fragile gift economy of OZET's 22nd Generation.  Onions, beets, plum brandy, sheep.

Scott Blumenthal & Aaron Meicht performed.  We made a film of that performance!  Here is that [film](https://youtu.be/NkZbwp7bs_g).
