# History

OZET is an ongoing artistic collaboration that encompasses a variety of live performances, films, studio-produced song recordings, and a band. Each piece of the project draws on and expands the fictional history of the Collective Sphere OZET.

OZET began in 2007, when Aaron started writing and performing musical forms inspired by his encounter with J.D. Bernal's prophetic 1929 scientific treatise "The World, The Flesh, and the Devil." These "Bernal Project" pieces also integrated ideas and text by Carl Sagan, Karl Kraus, Mark Kurlansky, Barbara Rosenwein, and Peter Singer. In the late Summer of 2008, Scott joined Aaron in evolving the project, and together they developed the idea of the Collective Sphere OZET.

Most recently, in January 2012, Incubator Arts Project presented "Common Hall Village 20," an immersive, multimedia, performance featuring the OZET Band and a rotating cast of over twenty performers.

In August 2010, Aaron and Scott presented "Alberts I-V" at HERE. This theatrical-music work, produced with the help of a dozen collaborators, delved into the pre-history of the OZET.

Aaron and Scott have also presented two OZET pieces as part of the Ontological Theater's Incubator Series: "there's a distance at which control returns to us" combined saxophone, trumpet, and broadcasted spoken text to look inside the story of one of the OZET's first settlers and "Koba/OZET Songbook" was a two-part piece consisting of a thirty minute murder mystery for saxophone quartet, banjo, guitar, trumpet, and three actors, followed by a performance of six songs drawn from the official and folk cultures of the OZET, backed by a full rock band. "LULLABY FROM THE FIRST GENERATION OF THE [YOUR SHIP NAME HERE] TO THE LAST", performed at Listen/Space, was a full-out audience-participation sing-along, celebrating the pioneers who left earth for OZET, and the legacy they bequeathed to their children.

Throughout their collaboration, Aaron and Scott have been writing and recording a collection of songs they call the "OZET Songbook". With Daniel "Space Monkey" Baker, they appear as the OZET Band, a trio exclusively dedicated to performing these songs.

OZET's most recent piece, "Katorga", was be presented by Incubator Arts Project in June, 2014.
