### {{ page.title }}

When cockleburs attach themselves<br/>
to passers-by they can't know where<br/>
they're going<br/>
They only hear the echo of<br/>
their mother saying "You were born<br/>
to leave.

"You're shaped for just one destiny;<br/>
that hook-nose and your thorny<br/>
disposition<br/>
cut the profile of an exile,<br/>
with a heart that's made<br/>
to grieve."

Now we're clinging to a comet<br/>
on our way to God-knows-where<br/>
And our mother doesn't miss us<br/>
and we can't afford to care.<br/>
It may be we have a purpose<br/>
but it isn't in our hands<br/>
whether we will come to rest on<br/>
fertile soil<br/>
or barren sands

The days were short, the nights were long,<br/>
the situation grim when they<br/>
discovered<br/>
that this dark and dormant comet<br/>
would pass close enough for some to<br/>
hitch a ride<br/>

The scientists and commissars<br/>
informed the undesirables:<br/>
"You're going.<br/>
Do your farming on the surface,<br/>
build your taverns and your villages<br/>
inside."<br/>

Now were grinding rocks for soil<br/>
and we're making air to breathe<br/>
and we're burrowing and furrowing<br/>
our brows and can't believe<br/>
That we're hurling through the cosmos<br/>
and nobody understands<br/>
why our destiny is crafting<br/>
fertile soil<br/>
from barren sands
