### {{ page.title }}

In our fortieth year,<br/>
in the late nineteen sixties<br/>
when we hadn't passed Saturn<br/>
and the sun shone upon us,<br/>
in Blagoveshchensk<br/>
which is now Village Twenty,<br/>
lived a man and his son<br/>
and his grandson together.<br/>

Just try to imagine<br/>
an OZET so different:<br/>
where children know parents<br/>
and serve them and love them.<br/>
And try to imagine<br/>
that blood is still greedy<br/>
and air hard to come by<br/>
and food even scarcer.<br/>

With wings on each morning,<br/>
he sets out for Albazin<br/>
which is now Village Fourteen.<br/>
He sits with a quorum<br/>
of old men like him<br/>
who remember the Volga<br/>
and how one could ache<br/>
from the effort of walking.<br/>

They read from a book<br/>
that was smuggled in pieces<br/>
from earth, then stitched back together.<br/>
They argue the meaning<br/>
of things said on mountains:<br/>
the word in the desert.<br/>

Believe me, my cousins,<br/>
that life isn't always<br/>
like what came before it:<br/>
The soil is changed by each harvest.<br/>

At home, in his hammock,<br/>
his son hasn't risen.<br/>
He sags in the darkness<br/>
and curses the father<br/>
who traded his birthright<br/>
of meadows for nothing<br/>
but stories and statutes<br/>
and stale incantations.<br/>

With hours of driving<br/>
a shovel before him.<br/>
The vacuum above him,<br/>
a vacuum inside him,<br/>
he boils a porridge<br/>
of buckwheat and leaves it:<br/>
his son is still growing<br/>
and trusting, and needs it.<br/>

Believe me, my cousins,<br/>
that life isn't always<br/>
like what came before it:<br/>
The soil is changed by each harvest.<br/>
The child is not like his father.

The grandson is dreaming.<br/>
A boy he knows told him<br/>
they're building a city in the desert.<br/>
He's there, under towers<br/>
where laws will be written.<br/>
He dreams he can climb these mountains.<br/>

The soil is changed by each harvest.<br/>
The child is not like his father.<br/>
The law is rewrit with each judgement.

Something's lost,<br/>
something's gained.
