### {{ page.title }}

We have a kitchen table<br>
we look across each morning<br>
while in the Common Hall the men are sharing tea.<br>
And you can see the curtains<br>
that hide the neighbors' bedroom<br>
over my shoulder through the window by the sink.

We claimed the ancient privilege<br>
to never leave each other.<br>
The Council doesn't dare to ban a love like ours.<br>
But I can see the wisdom<br>
of never being someone<br>
that anyone could never want to live without.

Was I a different man<br>
When I gave my word and made this life?<br>
And would a different man<br>
have choices left to make?

I like to stay out drinking<br>
until the tavern closes.<br>
I like to work as if I'm part of a machine.<br>
I like to fight with brothers<br>
who claim that God is watching<br>
And judging all our choices.

Was I a different man<br>
When I gave my word and made this life?<br>
And would a different man<br>
have choices left to make?

We hear the baby crying.<br>
You get up from the table<br>
and lift him to your freckled shoulder as you sing.<br>
I'd like to kiss your shoulder<br>
and be the man who loves him.<br>
Breakfast is over though, you tell me don't be late.

Was I a different man<br>
When I gave my word and made this life?<br>
And would a different man<br>
have choices left to make?
