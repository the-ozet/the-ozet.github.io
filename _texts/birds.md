### {{ page.title }}

I had a vision, an experiment to try: put birds in boxes, lift them by balloons.

In the forest near my mother's house I caged a mating pair -- Bohemian Waxwings<br>
singing in a pine tree like soprano bells in the Church of the Exaltation of the Cross.

The box was tin. I put their nest inside, and a telegraphone to catch their sounds.<br>
I thought their song might change up in the stratosphere.<br>
I thought the altitude might cause euphoria or panic.<br>
I left them room to flap their wings and if the air could hold them fly.<br>

I rigged a clock to drop a fistful of berries washed in<br>
arsenic and save them from freezing in the mesosphere.<br>

The students at the Trade School didn't like me, though. They started rumors.<br>
They said I wanted to escape to Germany or Sweden<br>
in a craft that Party airplanes couldn't follow.

The police appeared and took me from a stubbly Autumn field<br>
as my birds topped five kilometers.<br>
I didn't see them coming.<br>
I never heard the singing.<br>
They asked me what we're learning.

Put birds in boxes, lift them by balloons.<br>
Put birds in boxes, lift them by balloons.
