If the rye still grew<br/>
at least<br/>
the people would have rye.<br/>
When something's scarce,<br/>
the people brood<br/>
on what else they don't have,<br/>
and what they've got<br/>
they're hot to trade.

Take this guitar<br/>
made on Earth<br/>
from Baltic birch<br/>
nineteen generations back:<br/>
dream you had a father<br/>
and he gave it to you<br/>
like his father gave it to him.<br/>
Very nice.<br/>
A teacher hocked<br/>
for ten bars of soap,<br/>
tea and jam.<br/>
You can bet he's got a woman<br/>
in his sights.

Look around<br/>
son,<br/>
ain't that hard to see:<br/>
things weren't as bad as they are<br/>
well<br/>
they'd be worse for me.

Long nights of hunger,<br/>
days bored and dry.<br/>
They had to stop the wind last week.

Hard to keep your hands clean<br/>
when you've got to bury your stash.<br/>
I've been sent up twice:<br/>
Lost seven years and<br/>
I won't count<br/>
the opportunities.<br/>
Each time they let me out<br/>
I leave another cache behind:<br/>
naked lady playing cards,<br/>
a vial of opium tincture<br/>
bricked inside a cell wall.

You have to know your customers.<br/>
You have to know the footpaths through the forest.<br/>
You have to know which ducts have loose covers.<br/>
You have to know the value<br/>
of patina and perfume.

Look around<br/>
son,<br/>
ain't that hard to see:<br/>
things weren't as bad as they are<br/>
well<br/>
they'd be worse for me.

Can't say what happened.<br/>
The crops just die,<br/>
for lack of something in the soil<br/>
that once was there.<br/>
Now it's gone.
