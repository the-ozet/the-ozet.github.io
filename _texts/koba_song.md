<br/>
SCOTT/AARON:<br/>
Someone must have known him<br/>
and someone must have killed him<br/>
and someone has to find the one who<br/>
killed the only stranger.<br/>

SCOTT:<br/>
We know the tractor drivers

AARON:<br/>
We know the council chairman

SCOTT:<br/>
We know the engineer who runs the morning tram.

We number fourteen hundred

AARON:<br/>
and nobody goes missing<br/>
but Botso found a stranger in his kitchen, dead.

SCOTT:<br/>
Endzela claimed she saw him<br/>
last Tuesday by the river<br/>
She thought that it was Mukhran so she called his name

AARON:<br/>
But when she saw his profile,<br/>
the clothes that he was wearing,<br/>
the unfamiliar hat and shoes she gasped and ran.

SCOTT/AARON:<br/>
Someone must have known him<br/>
and someone must have killed him<br/>
and someone has to find the one who<br/>
killed the only stranger.

AARON:<br/>
The district sent for Koba.<br/>
They found him in the tavern.

SCOTT:<br/>
"I haven't had a case in years," he told his drink.

He went for Botso's story,<br/>
but got complaints and cursing:								

AARON:<br/>
"I kill my fields to meet these quotas, still you see

"each day my soup gets thinner,<br/>
however big the harvest.<br/>
Don't know who's eating all the food but it's not me."

SCOTT:<br/>
Koba was sick and cross-eyed<br/>						
from Kutsna's cheapest vodka.<br/>
He couldn't find Endzela so he went to bed.

When Koba woke that evening<br/>
his bedroom stank of urine.

AARON:<br/>
"Got news for you," said Utscha from the open door.

He came from the resistance.<br/>
They live under the city.<br/>
"Ain't that worth twenty rubles, Dick?" the beggar winked.

SCOTT:<br/>
Next morning found his body<br/>
stuffed in a narrow culvert.<br/>
Three farmers had to yank him so the stream could flow.

AARON:<br/>
"Get out and find some answers,"<br/>
the district chief demanded.<br/>
"Those wings weren't made for sitting on your ass all day."

SCOTT/AARON:<br/>
Someone must have known him<br/>
and someone must have killed him<br/>
and someone has to find the one who<br/>
killed the only stranger.

AARON:<br/>
"She may be in the city,"<br/>
Endzela's neighbor told him<br/>
"There is a man she sometimes sees, or so I hear."

"They say he's in the council,<br/>
Can't tell you why he'd want her.<br/>
Her eyes have lost their sparkle... well, I guess you know."

SCOTT:<br/>
The city lights gave Koba<br/>
an unrelenting headache.<br/>
The council member's doorman would not let him pass.

"Just let me see the woman<br/>
that visits on the weekends."

AARON:<br/>
"I'll tell her where to find you for a bit of change."

Ten minutes to last call, the tavern door swung open<br/>
Endzela walked in, said "Buy your girl a drink.

"You don't know what you're into.<br/>
Go back to Village Twenty.<br/>
Tell them you couldn't find me. I'm not coming home."

SCOTT:<br/>
The vodka cured his headache.<br/>
The barman closed the tavern.<br/>
two blocks away, three men<br/>
grabbed Koba from behind

They took him down an alley,<br/>
knocked out his teeth with hammers,<br/>
left him to wonder why<br/>
they had not left him dead.

AARON:<br/>
"You piece of shit, how are you?<br/>									
It's been a long time, Koba,"<br/>
said Nikoloz the Engineer who ran the pipes.

SCOTT:<br/>
"How much crap can you handle<br/>
before the sewers buckle?<br/>
Could more than fourteen hundred souls live on this ship?"

AARON:<br/>
"We've got the guts to deal with<br/>
Upwards of sixteen hundred.<br/>
Would not have built that big myself, but there you are.

"The architects of OZET<br/>
were from the Earth, remember.<br/>
No telling what they had in mind so long ago.

SCOTT/AARON:<br/>
Someone must have known him<br/>
and someone must have killed him<br/>
and someone has to find the one who<br/>
killed the only stranger.

TAPE:
Koba walked<br/>
home.<br/>
Broken wings,<br/>
broken teeth.<br/>
Limped across<br/>
fields.<br/>
Skinny cows.<br/>
Wilting wheat.

Down by the river he<br/>
pictured Endzela then<br/>
followed the tow path right<br/>
into the forest as<br/>
evening was falling and<br/>
found in a coppice of<br/>
hornbeams a shelter, a<br/>
blanket inside it, a

pair of pants<br/>
fork and knife<br/>
radio<br/>
playing<br/>
a song<br/>
playing a song<br/>
playing a song<br/>
he'd never heard<br/>
in his life										

AARON:<br/>
"Where are you going, Koba?"<br/>
the district chief demanded.<br/>
"You're off the case, the council sent it up the line."

SCOTT:<br/>
"I found a little tavern<br/>
when I was in the city.<br/>
They serve my favorite vodka, you can find me there."

[SPOKEN PART BY SCOTT]

SCOTT/AARON:<br/>
Now Koba runs a tavern<br/>
that stocks his favorite vodka.<br/>
You'll find him pouring it for OZET's hopeless souls.
