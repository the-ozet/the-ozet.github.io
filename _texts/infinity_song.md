#### Introduction

In celebration<br/>
of the good news declared on the first day<br/>
of the tenth year of the Sixth Generation of OZET Pioneers,<br/>
that the moribund transport vessels on the surface<br/>
beneath the desert floor<br/>
Were fitted in fact<br/>
for one last trip<br/>
by the Old Bolsheviks,<br/>
and that,<br/>
according to the observations<br/>
of the Astronomers of the Academy,<br/>
the OZET's course was set<br/>
almost certainly,<br/>
though without our knowledge,<br/>
to encounter a planetary system<br/>
suitable<br/>
to the needs of<br/>
endless future generations<br/>
and the permanent establishment<br/>
of our newly perfected society,<br/>
the forty members of the Council of the OZET,<br/>
as one, sanctioned <br/>
the production of this song<br/>
expressing our collective joy and hope.<br/>

Cousins: sing.<br/>

#### Refrain

At the dawn<br/>
of the day

in the Age of Forever<br/>
in the Age of Forever!

voices raised

awake at the dawn<br/>
of the day

#### Call and Response

You who are living<br/>
_We who are living_<br/>
Ah!

Follow the dying<br/>
_Follow the dying_<br/>
Ah!

To the beginning<br/>
_To the beginning_<br/>
Ah!

One day arriving<br/>
_One day arriving_<br/>
Ah!

Beyond<br/>
Sun<br/>
and Flood<br/>
and dark<br/>
finally

where we are sent to be<br/>

#### Unison

All a weigh<br/>
on the day<br/>
out beyond<br/>
every ray<br/>
of the sun<br/>
breaks the dawn<br/>
a song<br/>
the age.

All a weigh<br/>
voices raised<br/>
upon<br/>
the waves<br/>
so breaks<br/>
the long day
