### {{ page.title }}

Picture me here<br>
in a spider's egg<br>
in a cosmic breeze<br>
in the sun<br>

Tea cups are laughing at<br>
tea drops adrift<br>
on the run<br>

Liquids and powders<br>
swirling around us;<br>
no way of holding them down.<br>
Three-dimensional life!<br>

A slight push,<br>
a good jump<br>
set me spinning the length of the globe.<br>
Some short wings,<br>
a light wind<br>
bring me home.
