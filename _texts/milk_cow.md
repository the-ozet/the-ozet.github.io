### {{ page.title }}

My neighbor had a milk cow<br/>
that he bought for fifty rubles<br/>
from a cousin who had won it<br/>
playing poker with the Mayor<br/>
though the Mayor didn’t own it<br/>
it belonged to Village Twenty<br/>
and he lied and told the farmers
that their cow had just gone missing.

So my neighbor with his milk cow<br/>
fattened up the local children<br/>
and the women all adored him<br/>
and the mooing drove me crazy.<br/>
I believe the cow had nightmares<br/>
I would hear it crying murder<br/>
through the quiet Summer evenings,<br/>
through the Winter’s blackest midnights,<br/>
and it didn’t stop at sunrise,<br/>
though its moos became contented<br/>
that the nightmare time was over<br/>
and the milking time was nearing.

In the Spring I lost my patience<br/>
and appeared before the Council<br/>
to demand my neighbor’s milk cow<br/>
be remanded to its village<br/>
or at least placed in the dairy<br/>
where our common cows were sheltered<br/>
after all, this was the OZET,<br/>
and what one man owned we all owned.

Was it right that he should use it<br/>
to put cream into his coffee<br/>
and put butter on his rye bread<br/>
and seduce the local women<br/>
when my coffee tasted bitter  
and my nights were so tormented?

Well, the council members sent me<br/>
to the hall while they debated.<br/>
I had barely finished rolling<br/>
my first cigarette before they<br/>
sent a bailiff from the chamber<br/>
to arrest me on three charges,<br/>
and the Chairman of the Council<br/>
read each charge with bitter diction:

Allegation One was libel<br/>
toward the Mayor of the Village<br/>
that had lost its favorite milk cow,<br/>
and the second charge extortion,<br/>
and the final count against me<br/>
was conspiracy to something<br/>
I could not make out before they<br/>
dragged me kicking from the chamber.

And I guess I had it coming<br/>
if I think upon my motives<br/>
as I wait down here in prison<br/>
for my unknown day of freedom.

There’s no God out here in Heaven<br/>
that would second-guess the wisdom<br/>
of the Mighty and the Duly<br/>
and the Righteously Appointed<br/>
to the Regiment of Justice<br/>
for the Safety of the People<br/>
and Longevity of
OZET

No, you don't fuck with judgement<br/>
of The Solomonic Council<br/>
of our dear collective home.
