### {{ page.title }}

It's true:<br/>
I climbed to find you<br/>
in the winnowing barn.<br/>

I swear<br/>
I heard you clearly.<br/>
"Come with me.<br/>
You have to leave."<br/>

My eyesâ€”<br/>
you must have seen them,<br/>
but your face was a stone.<br/>

You never said this would be painless.<br/>
You never said you'd treat me kindly.<br/>
I want to know all of your reasons,<br/>
and just who you're looking out for.<br/>

Oh well.<br/>
I could have kept on<br/>
and not sought after you,<br/>

gone home<br/>
to all the faces<br/>
I keep aching to see.<br/>

With time<br/>
I might forget them.<br/>
You won't promise a thing.<br/>

The road's neglected.<br/>
The air is acrid.<br/>
I would prefer<br/>
you keep your silence.<br/>
I live in fear<br/>
I'll hear you whisper<br/>
"This is not<br/>
what I intended."
