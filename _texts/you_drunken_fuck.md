Yana Daniele<br/>
when she was young<br/>
Yana heard stories from her sister<br/>
about the things that boys and girls <br/>
used to say <br/>
to each other.<br/>
So one day when<br/>
they were children<br/>
alone<br/>
by the lake<br/>
in Sachkhere park<br/>
Yana promised herself<br/>
to Grigory Papiashvili.

You nurse your grudge and nurse your drink,<br/>
this one will be the last, you think.<br/>
Forget her, Grigory, you think that you're the only one?<br/>
A woman's promise made is not the same<br/>
as a promise kept,<br/>
you drunken fuck.<br/>
It's sweeter though by far.

Gigi<br/>
Papiashvili<br/>
Was moved away.<br/>
He worked hard but never talked much<br/>
about the things that other men<br/>
like to say to each other.<br/>
Then one day<br/>
Gigi saw Yana<br/>
hair soft and black<br/>
and singing<br/>
like a night bird<br/>
at the Festival of<br/>
the Fifteenth Generation.<br/>
He watched her throat move.

The quiet one, the gentle one,<br/>
the heartsick, sentimental one's <br/>
the one you want to watch for in the dark across the street.<br/>
He hates you but he thinks no one has ever loved like this<br/>
That drunken fuck,<br/>
sick of tasting his own blood.

Gigi<br/>
met Yana<br/>
outside the hall,<br/>
heard the chorus voices rising.<br/>
called her name and watched her eyes<br/>
cop that she<br/>
didn't know him.<br/>
The next day they<br/>
found her body<br/>
alone by the lake<br/>
in Sachkhere park.<br/>
Brothers promise yourselves<br/>
to vodka and to OZET!

You nurse your grudge and nurse your drink,<br/>
this one will be the last, you think.<br/>
Old-fashioned, Grigory, you can't believe what old men say:<br/>
That man is born and lives to murder what his heart cannot possess.<br/>
You drunken fuck!<br/>
A man owns nothing in this world.
