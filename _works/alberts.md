## Alberts I-V

Ten years before the historic launch of the Collective Sphere OZET, five men endure eight grueling months of astronautical training in a secret facility three miles west of Zhytomyr. Two pioneers make the cut. A new chapter in the evolving OZET saga, featuring live acoustic and electronic music, dialogue, film, scientific exposition, boxing, duct tape, pickles and vodka.
