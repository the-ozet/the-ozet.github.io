## Common Hall Village 20  

### Location

Incubator Arts Project

### Summary

On the eve of the Festival of the Fifteenth Generation, the Pioneers of Village 20 gather to watch The Council’s official broadcast. The vodka is free, the band plays anthems and local favorites, and the villagers wonder, “Will the soil recover? Are the men in the corner really here to help?” Before the celebration ends, a shocking interruption will expose a fissure in the OZET’s Utopian facade, and the Pioneers will face the beginning of a new, troubled age. 

CVH20 was inspired in equal parts by images from the Romanian Revolution, the writings of J.D. Bernal, the life and music of Woody Guthrie, and the creators' years as participant-observers in the local scene at the 80-year-old Washington Heights watering hole Reynold's Cafe.
