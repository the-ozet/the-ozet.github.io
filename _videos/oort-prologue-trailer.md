The collaborative OZET continues its decade-long exploration into the story of an agrarian, socialistic society of exiles, consigned to a comet, traveling away from Earth into deep space.

OoRT Prologue, a theatrical-musical ritual, portrays one man's role in maintaining the fragile gift economy of OZET's 22nd Generation. Onions, beets, cabbage, plum brandy, sheep.
